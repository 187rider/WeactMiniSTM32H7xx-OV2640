  33:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  *   Proc. SIGGRAPH '82, Computer Graphics v.16 #3 (July 1982), pp 297-304.
  34:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  *
  35:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * In the first pass over the image, we accumulate a histogram showing the
  36:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * usage count of each possible color.  To keep the histogram to a reasonable
  37:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * size, we reduce the precision of the input; typical practice is to retain
  38:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * 5 or 6 bits per color, so that 8 or 4 different input values are counted
  39:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * in the same histogram cell.
  40:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  *
  41:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * Next, the color-selection step begins with a box representing the whole
  42:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * color space, and repeatedly splits the "largest" remaining box until we
  43:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * have as many boxes as desired colors.  Then the mean color in each
  44:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * remaining box becomes one of the possible output colors.
  45:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * 
  46:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * The second pass over the image maps each input pixel to the closest output
  47:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * color (optionally after applying a Floyd-Steinberg dithering correction).
  48:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * This mapping is logically trivial, but making it go fast enough requires
  49:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * considerable care.
  50:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  *
  51:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * Heckbert-style quantizers vary a good deal in their policies for choosing
  52:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * the "largest" box and deciding where to cut it.  The particular policies
  53:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * used here have proved out well in experimental comparisons, but better ones
  54:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * may yet be found.
  55:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  *
  56:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * In earlier versions of the IJG code, this module quantized in YCbCr color
  57:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * space, processing the raw upsampled data without a color conversion step.
  58:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * This allowed the color conversion math to be done only once per colormap
  59:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * entry, not once per pixel.  However, that optimization precluded other
  60:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * useful optimizations (such as merging color conversion with upsampling)
  61:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * and it also interfered with desired capabilities such as quantizing to an
  62:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * externally-supplied colormap.  We have therefore abandoned that approach.
  63:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * The present code works in the post-conversion color space, typically RGB.
  64:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  *
  65:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * To improve the visual quality of the results, we actually work in scaled
  66:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * RGB space, giving G distances more weight than R, and R in turn more than
  67:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * B.  To do everything in integer math, we must use integer scale factors.
  68:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * The 2/3/1 scale factors used here correspond loosely to the relative
  69:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * weights of the colors in the NTSC grayscale equation.
  70:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * If you want to use this code to quantize a non-RGB color space, you'll
  71:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * probably need to change these scale factors.

 584:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  *
 585:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * Our method of efficiently finding nearest colors is based on the "locally
 586:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * sorted search" idea described by Heckbert and on the incremental distance
 587:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * calculation described by Spencer W. Thomas in chapter III.1 of Graphics
 588:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * Gems II (James Arvo, ed.  Academic Press, 1991).  Thomas points out that
 589:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * the distances from a given colormap entry to each cell of the histogram can
 590:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * be computed quickly using an incremental method: the differences between
 591:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * distances to adjacent cells themselves differ by a constant.  This allows a
 592:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * fairly fast implementation of the "brute force" approach of computing the
 593:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * distance from every colormap entry to every histogram cell.  Unfortunately,
 594:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * it needs a work array to hold the best-distance-so-far for each histogram
 595:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * cell (because the inner loop has to be over cells, not colormap entries).
 596:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * The work array elements have to be INT32s, so the work array would need
 597:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * 256Kb at our recommended precision.  This is not feasible in DOS machines.
 598:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  *
 599:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * To get around these problems, we apply Thomas' method to compute the
 600:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * nearest colors for only the cells within a small subbox of the histogram.
 601:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * The work array need be only as big as the subbox, so the memory usage
 602:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * problem is solved.  Furthermore, we need not fill subboxes that are never
 603:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * referenced in pass2; many images use only part of the color gamut, so a
 604:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * fair amount of work is saved.  An additional advantage of this
 605:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * approach is that we can apply Heckbert's locality criterion to quickly
 606:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * eliminate colormap entries that are far away from the subbox; typically
 607:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * three-fourths of the colormap entries are rejected by Heckbert's criterion,
 608:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * and we need not compute their distances to individual cells in the subbox.
 609:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * The speed of this approach is heavily influenced by the subbox size: too
 610:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * small means too much overhead, too big loses because Heckbert's criterion
 611:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * can't eliminate as many colormap entries.  Empirically the best subbox
 612:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * size seems to be about 1/512th of the histogram (1/8th in each direction).
 613:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  *
 614:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * Thomas' article also describes a refined method which is asymptotically
 615:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * faster than the brute-force method, but it is also far more complex and
 616:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * cannot efficiently be applied to small subboxes.  It is therefore not
 617:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * useful for programs intended to be portable to DOS machines.  On machines
 618:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * with plenty of memory, filling the whole histogram in one shot with Thomas'
 619:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * refined method might be faster than the present code --- but then again,
 620:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * it might not be any faster, and it's certainly more complicated.

1093:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * The raw F-S error computation can potentially compute error values of up to
1094:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * +- MAXJSAMPLE.  But we want the maximum correction applied to a pixel to be
1095:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * much less, otherwise obviously wrong pixels will be created.  (Typical
1096:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * effects include weird fringes at color-area boundaries, isolated bright
1097:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * pixels in a dark area, etc.)  The standard advice for avoiding this problem
1098:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * is to ensure that the "corners" of the color cube are allocated as output
1099:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * colors; then repeated errors in the same direction cannot cause cascading
1100:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * error buildup.  However, that only prevents the error from getting
1101:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * completely out of hand; Aaron Giles reports that error limiting improves
1102:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * the results even with corner colors allocated.
1103:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * A simple clamping of the error values to about +- MAXJSAMPLE/8 works pretty
1104:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * well, but the smoother transfer function used below is even better.  Thanks
1105:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jquant2.c ****  * to Aaron Giles for this idea.
