  22:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * In the current system design, the main buffer need never be a full-image
  23:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * buffer; any full-height buffers will be found inside the coefficient or
  24:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * postprocessing controllers.  Nonetheless, the main controller is not
  25:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * trivial.  Its responsibility is to provide context rows for upsampling/
  26:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * rescaling, and doing this in an efficient fashion is a bit tricky.

  30:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * sample rows of each component.  (We require DCT_scaled_size values to be

  32:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * values will likely be powers of two, so we actually have the stronger
  33:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * condition that DCT_scaled_size / min_DCT_scaled_size is an integer.)
  34:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * Upsampling will typically produce max_v_samp_factor pixel rows from each
  35:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * row group (times any additional scale factor that the upsampler is
  36:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * applying).
  37:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  *
  38:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * The coefficient controller will deliver data to us one iMCU row at a time;
  39:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * each iMCU row contains v_samp_factor * DCT_scaled_size sample rows, or
  40:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * exactly min_DCT_scaled_size row groups.  (This amount of data corresponds
  41:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * to one row of MCUs when the image is fully interleaved.)  Note that the
  42:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * number of sample rows varies across components, but the number of row
  43:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * groups does not.  Some garbage sample rows may be included in the last iMCU
  44:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * row at the bottom of the image.
  45:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  *
  46:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * Depending on the vertical scaling algorithm used, the upsampler may need
  47:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * access to the sample row(s) above and below its current input row group.
  48:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * The upsampler is required to set need_context_rows TRUE at global selection
  49:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * time if so.  When need_context_rows is FALSE, this controller can simply
  50:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * obtain one iMCU row at a time from the coefficient controller and dole it
  51:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * out as row groups to the postprocessor.
  52:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  *
  53:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * When need_context_rows is TRUE, this controller guarantees that the buffer
  54:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * passed to postprocessing contains at least one row group's worth of samples
  55:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * above and below the row group(s) being processed.  Note that the context
  56:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * rows "above" the first passed row group appear at negative row offsets in
  57:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * the passed buffer.  At the top and bottom of the image, the required
  58:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * context rows are manufactured by duplicating the first or last real sample
  59:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * row; this avoids having special cases in the upsampling inner loops.
  60:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  *
  61:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * The amount of context is fixed at one row group just because that's a
  62:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * convenient number for this controller to work with.  The existing
  63:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * upsamplers really only need one sample row of context.  An upsampler
  64:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * supporting arbitrary output rescaling might wish for more than one row
  65:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * group of context when shrinking the image; tough, we don't handle that.
  66:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * (This is justified by the assumption that downsizing will be handled mostly
  67:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * by adjusting the DCT_scaled_size values, so that the actual scale factor at
  68:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * the upsample step needn't be much less than one.)
  69:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  *
  70:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * To provide the desired context, we have to retain the last two row groups
  71:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * of one iMCU row while reading in the next iMCU row.  (The last row group
  72:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * can't be processed until we have another row group for its below-context,
  73:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * and so we have to save the next-to-last group too for its above-context.)
  74:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * We could do this most simply by copying data around in our buffer, but
  75:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * that'd be very slow.  We can avoid copying any data by creating a rather
  76:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * strange pointer structure.  Here's how it works.  We allocate a workspace
  77:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * consisting of M+2 row groups (where M = min_DCT_scaled_size is the number
  78:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * of row groups per iMCU row).  We create two sets of redundant pointers to
  79:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * the workspace.  Labeling the physical row groups 0 to M+1, the synthesized
  80:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * pointer lists look like this:
  81:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  *                   M+1                          M-1
  82:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * master pointer --> 0         master pointer --> 0

 101:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  *
 102:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * This scheme breaks down if M < 2, ie, min_DCT_scaled_size is 1.  In that

 106:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * rows when min_DCT_scaled_size is 1.  That combination seems unlikely to
 107:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * be worth providing --- if someone wants a 1/8th-size preview, they probably
 108:Middlewares/Third_Party/LibJPEG/source/jdmainct.c ****  * want it quick and dirty, so a context-free upsampler is sufficient.
